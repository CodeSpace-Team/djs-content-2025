Let's break down the user stories for the React podcast app project into categories and assign a difficulty level to each. The categories will be as follows:

1. **Setup and Deployment**: Tasks related to setting up the project and deploying it.
2. **UI/UX**: User interface and user experience-related tasks that focus on how the app looks and feels.
3. **Data Fetching and State Management**: Tasks related to retrieving data from the API and managing the state within the app.
4. **User Interaction**: Tasks that involve the functionality available to the user, such as listening to episodes, favouriting, and sorting/filtering content.
5. **Persistence and Storage**: Tasks related to storing user preferences and data across sessions and devices.
6. **Additional Features**: Additional functionalities that enhance the user experience.

Difficulty levels are:
- **Easy**: Basic implementation with little to no dependencies on other stories.
- **Medium**: Requires some understanding of multiple concepts or dependencies on other stories.
- **Hard**: Complex tasks that have multiple dependencies on other stories or require deep understanding of advanced concepts.
