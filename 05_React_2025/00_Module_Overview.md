# Module Overview

Welcome to the **React Fundamentals Module**, built around real Scrimba projects and progressive, hands-on practice. This module combines essential theory, live examples, and guided activities to take you from beginner to confident React developer — capable of building modular, data-driven, and interactive web applications.

React is used by companies like Facebook, Netflix, and Airbnb, and is one of the most in-demand skills in modern front-end development. This course is designed to teach you **the "why" and the "how"** using projects from Scrimba's top-rated React tracks.

## What You'll Learn

- The building blocks of React: components, JSX, and props
- How to create flexible, dynamic UIs using lists and state
- How to handle user input and build interactive forms
- How to manage side effects and fetch real data from APIs
- How to structure apps with clean, shared state architecture

This module is divided into **three core project-based phases**, each one mapped to a Scrimba course and a set of React lessons.

## How to Use This Module

- Each lesson contains **step-by-step instruction**, **hands-on coding tasks**, and **real-world examples**.
- After each major phase, refer to the linked **Scrimba project** to reinforce your learning.
- Lessons are progressive: don’t skip ahead until you’ve practiced the previous topic.

You can pause, replay, and code along with Scrimba to build full projects — then expand or customize them in your own editor.

## Let’s Get Started

Begin with **Lesson 1**: Understanding React in the Modern Web, and follow the lesson structure. When prompted, follow the linked Scrimba project for a guided build.

Happy coding!
