- `00:03:52.080`[the backend and the database and so](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:03:53.819`[forth it has meaning so you always you](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)

- `00:04:07.500`[save up yeah and it's just like things](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)

- `00:04:48.780`[starter plan or a you know or a free](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)

- `00:04:55.020`[things massages them so they play nice](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:04:56.759`[with one another just heed my warning](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:04:58.919`[that I said about design patterns don't](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:05:00.720`[follow them to the T but you know like](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:05:03.240`[there are some common things that you](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:05:05.160`[recurringly do and you can take](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:05:06.660`[inspiration from it so this just allows](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:05:09.060`[two interfaces to talk to one another](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:05:10.860`[you know so for example here first sale](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:05:12.780`[so first sale I get from company first](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:05:15.960`[sale date that is a string and so if it](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:05:18.780`[exists I create a date from that](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:05:20.400`[otherwise I'll just make it null because](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:05:22.259`[on the front end I'm just going to](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:05:23.880`[assume that it's a date or null so other](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:05:26.100`[things I infer So the plan I take](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:05:28.860`[expired trial and Slug and then based on](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:05:32.039`[that I create a plan object I have this](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:05:34.979`[function that creates this for me okay](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:05:37.080`[so there's a bit of translation going on](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:05:39.000`[not so much in the app that we are going](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:05:40.800`[to be building purely just because it's](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:05:43.380`[a very basic app you don't have a lot of](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:05:45.479`[complex things so let's just say we have](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:05:48.300`[in our API we have get movies list it](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:05:50.820`[might even be easier if I write the](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:05:52.560`[factory function for you guys like the](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:05:54.300`[Escape movies list and that just](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:05:57.240`[actually returns a promise with all the](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)

- `00:06:02.160`[interesting now I'm going to quickly](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:06:03.900`[just implement it and the next time I'm](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:06:05.520`[going to show you guys what promises are](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)

- `00:06:10.320`[preview in here okay so we have a list I](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:06:13.320`[usually also just type up my store so I](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:06:15.479`[do type the store itself list and](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:06:18.780`[preview and it's an array of these here](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:06:21.360`[Zoo Stan you can also use it as a](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:06:23.340`[factory function so then I can go create](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:06:25.740`[type store and I just do create store](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:06:28.620`[and I just run it like that and that](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:06:30.360`[passes generic to it oh just create not](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:06:33.000`[create store and I should then be able](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:06:35.160`[to to okay it complains because I said](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:06:37.560`[there's going to be a list in my store](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)

- `00:06:42.780`[our API return some fake stuff for now](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:06:44.940`[just throw it in here okay so list but I](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:06:48.539`[generally keep these three domains](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:06:50.400`[separate in my app so the API the](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)

- `00:07:05.280`[something called the mvvm pattern which](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:07:07.919`[effectively has a view model so Zoo](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)

- `00:07:32.940`[a lot more maintainable it's easier to](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:07:34.740`[reason about because as an example in](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:07:37.020`[that other project now I can talk about](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:07:39.120`[things in terms of what makes sense in](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:07:41.340`[the UI instead of now and being like Oh](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:07:43.380`[yeah how's it stored on the database and](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:07:45.419`[so Faker we need to pull in import ROM](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:07:49.500`[and let's just grab I wouldn't be happy](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:07:52.319`[with this level of coupling but I'm just](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:07:54.780`[doing it now just so we can get this](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:07:57.360`[going from](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:07:59.419`[opponents app yeah I wouldn't](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:08:01.319`[necessarily dive this directly into](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:08:03.300`[components and pull stuff out API I](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:08:05.880`[would also just type up the API so the](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:08:08.039`[type API and that gate movies list okay](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:08:10.620`[and create API needs to return an API](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:08:14.160`[the get movies list okay so let me just](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:08:16.080`[write it now so obviously this would](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:08:17.639`[then handle all of that but for now I'm](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:08:19.919`[just going to return the fake list that](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:08:22.860`[I created up here unhappy because it](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:08:24.780`[needs to be an async function and](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:08:26.520`[actually just to emulate that loading](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:08:28.319`[process I'm just going to wrap it in a](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:08:31.080`[set time all right let's do new promise](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:08:33.419`[resolve and wrap but in a safe time out](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:08:36.719`[it was just resolve the list and let's](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:08:40.380`[say it takes three seconds okay so this](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:08:42.240`[is just for testing purposes I'm going](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:08:44.159`[to talk about everything I'm doing here](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:08:45.839`[a bit later in the next session I just](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:08:49.440`[want to get it up and working so you](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:08:51.060`[guys can see what we're going to be](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:08:52.140`[working with create API so what I then](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:08:54.240`[do is in my store I pull in the API I'm](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:08:57.240`[also going to be doing dependency](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:08:58.740`[injection here in the next session to](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:09:01.380`[show you guys how you can swap out a](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:09:03.000`[testing API in your real API API and](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:09:06.180`[obviously I generally just also do](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:09:08.600`[index.ts and I just export all of that](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:09:11.220`[from like that so then I should be able](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:09:14.040`[to to create API okay and then in my](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:09:17.160`[store so this is a factory function so](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:09:19.620`[it just needs to return an object what](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:09:21.779`[what I actually generally do is I this I](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:09:25.260`[create the store separately and then put](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:09:27.180`[it in a hook I would say create stores I](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:09:29.880`[create the store separately and don't](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:09:31.980`[worry I'm going to talk about all of](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:09:33.360`[this stuff like if I'm moving very fast](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:09:35.160`[now so create my store separate](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:09:37.200`[separately so that Returns the store and](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:09:40.080`[I wrap that in a create store and then](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:09:43.140`[inside that create store and I would](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:09:45.779`[call this you know create Zoo standstall](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:09:48.240`[once again we're running out of names or](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:09:49.920`[things here and then create type store](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:09:52.080`[so in that I would create my store do](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:09:54.360`[all of this in here okay and so that](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:09:56.760`[stop my store starts out with list that](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:10:00.540`[is empty okay there you go there we go](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:10:02.880`[okay and then what I do is after I](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:10:06.480`[create the store I fire my request to](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:10:08.760`[get the data so then I would do from my](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:10:11.279`[API API so in my create store I create](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:10:13.860`[API and then I would do API get movies](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:10:16.860`[list this is where promises come in so I](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:10:19.980`[run that and I do then and once it comes](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:10:23.820`[back I take the data and I go store and](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:10:27.600`[set State on the store and I just](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:10:29.640`[replace list this API call returns D and](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:10:33.180`[it is unhappy because date is not](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:10:35.580`[assigned to string that is actually and](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:10:38.459`[it's because I'm now mixing my modeling](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:10:40.980`[with my API so preview release let's](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:10:45.240`[just make this a date okay that's fine](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:10:47.700`[set and we're not setting anything just](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:10:50.399`[yet here we're setting it here](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:10:52.019`[afterwards and what I would also do is I](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:10:54.480`[would do phase and I generally write my](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:10:57.060`[phases like this when I'm using stake](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:10:59.040`[machines so loading when the data comes](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:11:02.040`[in the phase changes to list listing and](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:11:06.180`[obviously my store doesn't account for](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:11:08.040`[that so we need to do phase listing and](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:11:11.459`[loading create store okay so now I'm](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:11:13.860`[creating my store and then what I would](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:11:16.500`[do is then I would just export my store](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:11:20.040`[so const store is just the created store](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:11:23.399`[here like we had the store and I export](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:11:25.560`[it and then what I can do is I can](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:11:27.360`[import that store into my components in](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:11:30.300`[my app I would go import my model the](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:11:34.079`[store and then from this stand I just](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:11:36.180`[grab a hook to use that store pass a](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:11:39.000`[store into you store to use it and I can](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:11:41.339`[extract something specific from it I](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:11:43.560`[might even just wrap my app in a](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:11:46.740`[container that way we can still I might](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:11:48.839`[actually split this up into shell or](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:11:51.660`[list and app let's quickly do that so](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:11:54.720`[the list would be something separate](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:11:56.519`[from the app itself the app would then](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:11:58.200`[have the logic and the list would](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:11:59.940`[actually just render the the actual](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:12:02.519`[component stuff so list again we just](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:12:05.160`[need to update the naming of all these](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:12:06.720`[things the list is is completely](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:12:08.700`[stateless I'm just updating it all over](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:12:11.519`[the place here let's change this to](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:12:13.680`[wrapper okay there we go and let's](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:12:15.420`[change this to movies oh we already have](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:12:17.700`[wrapper yeah I don't know what to call](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:12:19.860`[this let's just say in a list between](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:12:21.779`[movies map over movies so we just](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:12:24.899`[updated this this is movies okay so then](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:12:27.300`[the app itself would not have a](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:12:28.860`[storybook because that we don't pass any](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:12:31.740`[props to it we handle all our Zoo stand](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:12:34.260`[stuff in here so we're kind of following](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:12:36.420`[a container pattern we would then import](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:12:38.339`[a model into the app itself now might](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:12:40.680`[even take the app out of here and put it](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:12:42.899`[in my source just to create the](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:12:44.940`[separation between my actual components](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:12:47.459`[that get tested in story about their app](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:12:49.560`[itself which combines the model with the](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:12:52.320`[components and you would also have like](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:12:53.880`[any routing or whatever in here as well](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:12:56.100`[we would pull in the model here and we](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:12:58.200`[would pull in our components here and](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:13:00.180`[compose them together in our app over](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:13:02.880`[here for now let's just grab the list](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:13:05.160`[and from our model let's just grab the](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:13:08.399`[store and we also need to pull in zoo](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:13:11.339`[stand to combine those together use](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:13:13.560`[store I think in our components it would](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:13:15.720`[also be helpful to have a index.ts that](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:13:19.500`[just re-exports all our components now](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:13:21.959`[we create our actual app Here const app](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:13:24.720`[for now the list and we need to pass](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:13:27.240`[movies to the list okay and that we get](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:13:30.180`[from our store so let's set up a](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:13:33.120`[selector here and movies we get from you](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:13:36.120`[store so we consume a specific Store the](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:13:39.180`[store that we consume is the one we have](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:13:40.740`[in model you can have different stores I](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:13:43.079`[just call it store because I only have](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:13:44.459`[one and then you actually write what you](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:13:46.620`[want to grab from it why do you do it in](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:13:48.720`[this way and that's just for rendering](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:13:50.639`[and so forth performance reasons maybe](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:13:53.220`[also just can do is I can just export](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:13:55.019`[the create store I actually sometimes](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:13:56.760`[just actually generally I use I do it](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:13:58.980`[this way around I create my actual store](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:14:01.019`[in here as well I would create my store](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:14:03.480`[in the component itself and then pass](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:14:05.519`[the store into that okay it needs to](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:14:08.339`[return store API and I just pass the](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:14:11.220`[store into that so I can get store API](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:14:14.399`[from here phase you know if phase is](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:14:18.200`[loading then just return for now](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:14:21.120`[otherwise don't return loading return](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:14:24.360`[the list with the movies okay we just](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:14:26.579`[need to update this all for our new](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:14:28.440`[location and obviously app no longer](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:14:30.600`[takes that oh wait create API okay so](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:14:33.360`[I'm coupling my stuff way way too](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:14:35.519`[heavily here definitely in the next](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:14:37.440`[session I'm going to decouple some of it](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:14:39.060`[a bit I need to return this so I create](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:14:40.920`[the store but I never actually return it](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:14:43.019`[so I'm trying to pass undefined into Zoo](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:14:45.480`[stand oh I think I shouldn't create my](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:14:47.339`[API in the actual there's my problem](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:14:49.560`[what I generally do is I pass the API](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:14:52.260`[through to the store when I created](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:14:54.779`[instead of creating it in the store](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:14:56.519`[itself my app that I'd create the store](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:14:59.339`[and the API outside here and then pass](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:15:02.100`[the API into the store create API again](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:15:05.339`[I'd pass that into my store and then I](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:15:07.380`[would just use the store here reload](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:15:10.019`[loading loading loading loading way](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:15:12.180`[there it shows everything yeah I'm going](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:15:13.920`[to be working with this a bit next time](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:15:15.660`[so we have most of the base](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:15:17.639`[infrastructure here I'm just mocking the](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:15:20.579`[the process of requesting the data so](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:15:22.860`[what I'm going to be doing next time is](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
- `00:15:24.180`[actually going to be pulling in the data](https://tactiq.io/tools/run/js)
