### Lesson: Introduction to TypeScript

# TypeScript Walkthrough

While TypeScript is a fairly advanced language, merely knowing a bit of it opens various opportunities to work on larger, more complex software projects. Over the last couple of years, several tech companies have adopted TypeScript as their language of choice. This means that experience with TypeScript is becoming more in demand in the job market.

Jumping straight into TypeScript might sound scary; however, it is important to note two things:

- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning everything you’ve learned so far is completely valid TypeScript. All additional features and syntax that TypeScript adds on top of JavaScript are 100% optional, and you can pick and choose which you want to use.
- TypeScript mostly provides an easier way to add static type annotation inside our code, instead of as comments next to our code using JSDoc. You should be able to translate your understanding of JSDoc into TypeScript very easily.

### What is Static Typing?

Static typing is a feature of some programming languages where the type of a variable is known at compile time—this is before the program is executed. In languages with static typing, you must declare the type of every variable and function. This declaration allows the compiler to check that all operations performed on the variables are type-safe, such as ensuring that you're not trying to perform mathematical operations on a string or accessing a property that doesn't exist on an object.

The primary advantage of static typing is that it enables early detection of many types of errors. By catching these errors during the compilation process, static typing prevents a class of runtime errors that can be difficult to debug. This early feedback loop helps developers fix issues promptly, leading to more robust and reliable code.

Static typing also contributes to clearer documentation of the code. By looking at function signatures and variable declarations, developers can understand what types of data are expected, making the code easier to read and maintain. Additionally, many integrated development environments (IDEs) leverage static typing to provide advanced features like code completion, navigation, and refactoring tools, enhancing the developer's productivity.

Contrastingly, dynamically typed languages determine the type of a variable at runtime. This approach offers flexibility and can lead to quicker prototyping and shorter code. However, it lacks the compile-time checks that static typing provides, which can lead to runtime errors that are only discovered when the problematic code path is executed.

In summary, static typing is a critical feature for languages that prioritize early error detection, code clarity, and developer tooling support. It forms the foundation of TypeScript's ability to extend JavaScript with type safety, bringing the benefits of static typing to a traditionally dynamically typed language.

#### How Does Static Typing Relate to TypeScript?

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript, meaning that it adds static typing features to the language. JavaScript is dynamically typed, which allows for greater flexibility in how variables are used but can also lead to more runtime errors because types are determined on the fly. TypeScript addresses this by enabling developers to specify variable types and catch errors during the development process, rather than at runtime.

A superset of JavaScript refers to a programming language that extends JavaScript by adding new features and functionalities to it, while still being compatible with existing JavaScript code. This means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid in the superset language, but the superset language introduces additional syntax, constructs, or capabilities that are not present in standard JavaScript.

The term "superset" signifies that the language encompasses all aspects of JavaScript, along with its own extensions. These extensions can include new syntactical constructs, type systems, or features designed to improve the language’s usability, performance, safety, or to address certain challenges that might be more difficult to tackle using plain JavaScript

#### What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript, meaning that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. TypeScript extends JavaScript by adding static types to the code. These types provide a way to describe the shape and behavior of an object, making the code easier to read and debug. By incorporating these static types, developers can catch errors and bugs at compile time, significantly improving code quality and maintainability.

#### How TypeScript Relates to JavaScript

While JavaScript is a dynamically typed language where types are checked at runtime, TypeScript introduces static typing, where types are checked at compile time. This distinction allows TypeScript to offer a more robust development experience for large-scale applications where catching errors early can save time and resources. TypeScript compiles down to plain JavaScript, making it possible to run TypeScript applications in any environment that JavaScript supports.

#### TypeScript and Frameworks/Libraries

TypeScript is not a framework or a library; it's a language that can work seamlessly with JavaScript libraries and frameworks. Many popular frameworks and libraries, such as Angular, React, and Vue, have embraced TypeScript, offering official types or supporting TypeScript out of the box. The adoption of TypeScript with these tools enhances developer productivity and code safety, thanks to TypeScript's static type checking and advanced features like interfaces, generics, and namespaces.

#### TypeScript vs. Vanilla JavaScript

- **Readability and Maintainability**: TypeScript's type annotations improve code readability and make it easier to maintain, especially for large codebases.
- **Error Detection**: TypeScript's compile-time error checking helps identify type errors and bugs that would only be caught at runtime in vanilla JavaScript.
- **IDE Support**: TypeScript offers advanced autocompletion, navigation, and refactoring features in integrated development environments (IDEs), enhancing the developer experience.
- **Compatibility**: TypeScript compiles to vanilla JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with any browser, host, or operating system.
- **Learning Curve**: For developers new to typing concepts, there may be a learning curve. However, the investment in learning TypeScript often pays off in terms of code quality and developer productivity.

### What is the Use Case for TypeScript?

TypeScript is ideally suited for developing large-scale applications where managing complexity and maintaining code quality over time are critical. Its static type system helps document the code, making it clearer what each part of the application is supposed to do. This clarity is invaluable for teams, enabling new developers to understand the codebase quicker and contributing to better collaboration. Additionally, TypeScript is beneficial in projects that require long-term maintenance, as it helps identify potential errors early in the development process, reducing the likelihood of bugs making it into production.

### Why and Why Not to Use TypeScript?

#### Reasons to Use TypeScript:

- **Enhanced Code Quality**: Early error detection and static typing lead to fewer bugs in production.
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Features like auto-completion, code navigation, and refactoring tools streamline the development process.
- **Scalability**: Makes managing large codebases more manageable, supporting the development of complex applications.
- **Community and Ecosystem**: Strong support from a large community, with many libraries and frameworks offering TypeScript definitions out of the box.

#### Reasons Against Using TypeScript:

- **Learning Curve**: Requires learning new syntax and concepts, which might be challenging for beginners.
- **Compilation Step**: Adds an extra step to the development process since TypeScript code must be compiled to JavaScript.
- **May Introduce Complexity**: For small projects or prototypes, the benefits of TypeScript might not outweigh the initial setup and learning time.

### Why It Is Important to Know TypeScript as a New Software Developer?

Understanding TypeScript is becoming increasingly important for new software developers for several reasons:

- **Industry Trend**: Many companies and open-source projects are adopting TypeScript, indicating a shift towards typed languages in the JavaScript ecosystem.
- **Career Opportunities**: Knowledge of TypeScript opens up more job opportunities as demand grows for developers who can write typed JavaScript.
- **Foundation for Learning Other Languages**: Learning TypeScript introduces concepts found in statically typed languages like Java or C#, making it easier to learn these languages in the future.
- **Better Development Practices**: TypeScript encourages writing more predictable and understandable code, which are valuable skills for any developer.
