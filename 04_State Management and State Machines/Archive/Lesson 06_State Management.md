### State Management Techniques in Vanilla JavaScript

In the development of web applications, managing the state is a crucial aspect that determines how data flows and changes across the application. When working with vanilla JavaScript, without the direct support of frameworks like React or Vue, developers need to implement their own solutions for managing global state. This section explores various techniques for global state management in vanilla JavaScript applications, ensuring your application remains scalable and maintainable.

#### Global State Management

Global state management refers to handling the state that is shared across different parts of your application. This can include user authentication status, theme settings, or any other data that needs to be accessible by multiple components or functions. Managing global state effectively is key to creating responsive and user-friendly web applications.

Here are some techniques for managing global state in vanilla JavaScript:

##### 1. Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern is a design pattern where an object, known as the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. This pattern is particularly useful for implementing reactive data-binding that ensures the UI updates whenever the data changes.

To implement the Observer pattern for state management, you would create a store that holds the application state and notify components that subscribe to this store when any changes occur.

Example:

```javascript
class Store {
  constructor(initialState) {
    this.state = initialState;
    this.observers = [];
  }

  subscribe(observerFunction) {
    this.observers.push(observerFunction);
  }

  notifyAll() {
    this.observers.forEach(observer => observer(this.state));
  }

  updateState(newState) {
    this.state = { ...this.state, ...newState };
    this.notifyAll();
  }
}

// Usage
const appState = new Store({
  user: null,
  theme: 'light',
});

appState.subscribe((state) => console.log('State changed:', state));

appState.updateState({ user: 'Alice' });
```

##### 2. Publish/Subscribe Pattern

Similar to the Observer pattern, the Publish/Subscribe pattern allows parts of your application to subscribe to certain events and react when those events are published. This pattern decouples the sender and receiver of messages or events, making it easier to maintain and scale the application.

In the context of state management, components can subscribe to specific state changes and update themselves based on the new state.

Example:

```javascript
class PubSub {
  constructor() {
    this.subscribers = {};
  }

  subscribe(event, callback) {
    if (!this.subscribers[event]) {
      this.subscribers[event] = [];
    }
    this.subscribers[event].push(callback);
  }

  publish(event, data) {
    if (this.subscribers[event]) {
      this.subscribers[event].forEach(callback => callback(data));
    }
  }
}

// Usage
const stateManager = new PubSub();

stateManager.subscribe('themeChange', (theme) => {
  console.log(`Theme changed to: ${theme}`);
});

stateManager.publish('themeChange', 'dark');
```

##### 3. Global Object

A simpler approach, but less scalable, is using a global object to store the application state. This object can be accessed and modified by any part of the application. While this method is straightforward, it lacks the reactivity and structure provided by the Observer and Publish/Subscribe patterns, making it more suitable for smaller applications or prototypes.

Example:

```javascript
const globalState = {
  user: null,
  theme: 'light',
};

// Accessing and updating the state
console.log(globalState.theme); // 'light'
globalState.theme = 'dark';
console.log(globalState.theme); // 'dark'
```

Choosing the right technique for global state management in vanilla JavaScript depends on the complexity and size of your application. The Observer and Publish/Subscribe patterns provide a structured and scalable approach, enabling reactivity and decoupling components. For smaller applications or prototypes, a global object might suffice but be mindful of its limitations as your application grows. Understanding these techniques allows you to create more efficient and maintainable JavaScript applications.
