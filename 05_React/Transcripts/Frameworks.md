00:00:00.000
no surprises we are going to be talking
00:00:02.940
about JavaScript and we are going to be
00:00:04.799
talking about Frameworks obviously in
00:00:06.899
the content I didn't want to touch on
00:00:09.179
Frameworks too much because I I do think
00:00:12.360
there's a danger and I've kind of
00:00:14.219
mentioned this quite a bit in the videos
00:00:15.660
I think there's a danger in starting
00:00:18.359
with framework starting with the
00:00:20.400
abstractions in so far that they allow
00:00:22.980
you to move really fast they allow you
00:00:24.900
to build really cool things without
00:00:26.939
understanding JavaScript like even at
00:00:29.460
all but the danger then that's true then
00:00:32.159
then you get a job and you you find
00:00:34.380
yourself in a position where you've
00:00:35.880
learned this framework but you don't
00:00:37.559
understand anything below the framework
00:00:39.899
that kind of very much very limits your
00:00:42.719
career growth because first and foremost
00:00:45.000
the moment you want to apply for another
00:00:46.920
job that's not this framework there's a
00:00:49.800
problem secondly if this framework ever
00:00:52.020
like declines in popularity there's
00:00:54.300
another big problem also Frameworks are
00:00:56.820
tools and what happens is as you grow in
00:00:59.460
your career you actually spend less time
00:01:01.920
actually working with the framework and
00:01:04.319
you start actually spending more time
00:01:06.240
doing work at an architectural level at
00:01:08.700
a bigger level thinking in terms of
00:01:10.520
where does the framework fit in what
00:01:13.020
other libraries do we pull in do we use
00:01:15.360
this framework instead of that framework
00:01:17.340
instead of literally just learning oh
00:01:19.439
this is how to use a use statehood but
00:01:21.420
this is how to use a use effect work so
00:01:23.100
I think there's a big danger then I see
00:01:24.960
this in a lot of boot camps where they
00:01:26.939
learn you the basics of the framework to
00:01:28.799
get you up and started and quickly as
00:01:30.540
possible but you have no idea what it
00:01:32.820
does you just know if I press this
00:01:34.259
button this thing happens and like I
00:01:36.780
think that's actually very dangerous for
00:01:38.520
one's career growth yeah we find
00:01:40.200
ourselves at like at this point in the
00:01:42.540
industry that is very bottom heavy in
00:01:45.000
terms of there's a ton of Juniors so I
00:01:47.579
think also your primary focus as a
00:01:50.159
developer entering the job market should
00:01:52.020
be to get out of the junior pool as
00:01:53.880
quickly as possible so I have some bad
00:01:55.619
news for you if you thought like you
00:01:57.600
were learning a lot of stuff right now I
00:01:59.460
would actually say that it once you get
00:02:00.780
your job like your main goal should be
00:02:02.640
upskilling as quickly as possible and
00:02:04.740
because also you know like the tech
00:02:06.240
industry isn't a bit of a recession so
00:02:08.160
like it's definitely your best interest
00:02:10.020
to start kind of moving up that kind of
00:02:12.120
experience and seniority ladder as soon
00:02:14.280
as possible so this is just like a quick
00:02:16.379
public service announcement from my side
00:02:18.239
because I do think like these type of
00:02:19.980
things are also the value that you get
00:02:21.660
from studying at code space as opposed
00:02:24.180
to hey here's some udemy forces on
00:02:26.099
JavaScript it's kind of understanding
00:02:28.020
the specific context in which you're
00:02:29.819
finding yourself and the kind of South
00:02:31.560
African technology landscape and so
00:02:33.660
forth so but yeah like I I do I think
00:02:36.239
like I would personally if if I was in
00:02:38.819
your position I would even consider make
00:02:40.980
that my primary consideration even if
00:02:42.840
you're looking for jobs and one job pays
00:02:44.760
more than another one I would go the one
00:02:46.920
that provides more opportunities for
00:02:48.900
growth and that should be your primary
00:02:50.940
concern about everything else at this
00:02:52.739
point you'll also find if you read the
00:02:54.420
documentation because you also know a
00:02:56.700
bit more about JavaScript and terms and
00:02:58.560
stuff now you'll actually find it easier
00:03:01.019
because I do find the biggest hurdle in
00:03:03.360
terms of learning things is reading the
00:03:04.980
documentation and not actually knowing
00:03:07.019
what what the terms mean you know seeing
00:03:09.420
terms like declarative UI reactivity
00:03:12.000
crops like store and so forth also what
00:03:15.480
I want to do is the specific lesson
00:03:17.040
maybe we want to show a little bit of
00:03:18.720
react but I want to spend the majority
00:03:20.459
of time actually just contextualizing
00:03:22.319
what we're going to be doing up until
00:03:23.940
the end from here on out you know just
00:03:26.220
up front we are going to be spending the
00:03:29.459
most of our time looking at react purely
00:03:31.980
for the purpose that react is just hands
00:03:35.640
down the most popular framework in terms
00:03:37.680
of usage at this point I'll I'll dive a
00:03:40.080
bit deeper into the actual stats it
00:03:42.000
would be dishonest for me to teach you
00:03:44.580
guys any other framework regardless of
00:03:47.519
what my favorite one is if I know that
00:03:50.280
the market out there for react
00:03:52.140
developers is absolutely massive that
00:03:54.360
being said you might not enjoy react or
00:03:56.519
you might actually come across another
00:03:58.560
job that you really want that does not
00:04:00.480
react things change very quickly in five
00:04:02.640
years like you might want to change jobs
00:04:04.739
or whatever and react is actually not
00:04:07.200
that popular anymore so I think it's
00:04:09.180
worthwhile that we cover some of the
00:04:10.920
other Frameworks as well purely just
00:04:12.840
because of I think it's it's good to
00:04:14.640
have a t-shaped learning curve so where
00:04:17.519
you kind of specialize in something
00:04:18.839
specific but you have a broad working
00:04:21.060
knowledge of other things around it not
00:04:23.340
only in terms of just career you know
00:04:25.320
not putting all your eggs in one basket
00:04:26.759
but also just I think it also helps you
00:04:29.400
understand react better seeing how
00:04:31.560
others do it and kind of seeing some of
00:04:33.180
the underlying principles instead of
00:04:35.220
just learning react for what it is
00:04:36.919
whenever you talk about JavaScript
00:04:39.120
Frameworks usually that's either
00:04:41.880
followed by or preceded by the question
00:04:45.240
of which one should you choose most
00:04:48.000
discussions around Frameworks and
00:04:49.740
JavaScript is around which framework
00:04:51.479
should you choose there is a ton of
00:04:53.699
Articles out there on view versus react
00:04:56.940
versus angular versus svelte versus it
00:05:00.300
versus all of that so the reality is
00:05:02.699
unfortunately that there is no 100
00:05:06.240
correct answer and that's not me being
00:05:09.060
diplomatic you probably saw in the
00:05:11.340
content up until now that's like I am
00:05:13.139
very opinionated I'm I'm not someone
00:05:14.880
who's like ah you know it doesn't matter
00:05:17.160
um like I have very strong opinions
00:05:18.540
about JavaScript and I can tell you that
00:05:20.880
when it comes to Frameworks it's there
00:05:23.520
is no single true answer it's a very
00:05:25.979
difficult conversation to have anyone
00:05:28.380
who tells you that framework X is the
00:05:30.960
best competitive framework why or
00:05:32.639
whatever be careful of those type of
00:05:34.740
discussions like I think a lot of that
00:05:36.539
comes from just tribalism and whatever
00:05:39.120
the same people who argue that Canon is
00:05:41.280
better than Nikon and Nikon and Pokemon
00:05:43.440
is better than Digimon Orlando Pirates
00:05:45.960
is better oh okay let me not go there
00:05:47.759
but you you know what I'm getting at a
00:05:49.860
lot of that I think it's just tribalism
00:05:51.240
and fans and like not based on anything
00:05:53.400
real it's just like someone's own
00:05:55.199
personal preferences the question around
00:05:57.360
why react is actually very simple to
00:05:59.280
answer let's go to npm Trends I have no
00:06:02.880
idea what this red thing is that's going
00:06:05.039
on here like there's something weird
00:06:07.860
going on with npm Trends I remember when
00:06:10.800
you said this in the video yeah yeah I
00:06:12.900
like
00:06:13.740
um you had a stroke here or something
00:06:15.600
happened I don't know so just disregard
00:06:18.060
this little part I don't know what's
00:06:19.740
going on but you know if we look at the
00:06:22.440
trends if we were having this
00:06:24.180
conversation 2017 2018 2019 maybe 2020
00:06:28.080
it would have been a different
00:06:29.400
conversation so the big three ones are
00:06:31.560
angular react um and view those are the
00:06:34.319
big three ones this moment I would be
00:06:37.020
cautious of any team using anything else
00:06:41.220
apart from react view or angular in
00:06:44.280
production
00:06:45.240
um I think these are the big three ones
00:06:47.460
in terms of like being production ready
00:06:49.680
being stable and so forth there is one
00:06:52.199
that's upcoming that's called svelte
00:06:53.880
it's showing a lot of promise but it is
00:06:56.759
still very new compared to the others
00:06:58.680
I'm just including it because it does
00:07:02.100
actually show a lot of promise and a lot
00:07:05.220
of popularity despite how young it is
00:07:07.680
something weird also happened you have a
00:07:09.539
spelled I don't know what was going on
00:07:11.160
see how check how many GitHub Stars it
00:07:13.560
already has and despite it only being
00:07:16.080
six years old which is you know half the
00:07:18.840
like age of react but you'll see in
00:07:20.880
terms of usage it's around like 500
00:07:23.880
downloads a month whereas the others are
00:07:25.860
kind of like in the millions yeah keep
00:07:27.780
that in mind
00:07:28.919
um but I think it's worth touching on it
00:07:30.479
because who knows what this looks like
00:07:31.979
in three four five years it is
00:07:33.720
definitely kind of on the rise nowhere
00:07:36.300
near react there's a lot of people
00:07:37.800
speculating that F swelt ever Catches Up
00:07:40.620
by at that time the framework landscape
00:07:43.199
will be so different
00:07:45.120
um that will actually be outdated
00:07:46.560
because it is still very much kind of in
00:07:48.840
the same realm as kind of like all the
00:07:51.120
other big three ones um but yeah that's
00:07:53.340
something to keep in mind the other one
00:07:55.259
is lit we have touched on a bit lit is
00:07:58.259
in an interesting position
00:08:00.479
um not that much usage slightly more
00:08:03.599
than spelled I think it's good for
00:08:05.880
Learning and because that's so close to
00:08:08.039
the Dom itself I don't know if I would
00:08:11.460
use it in production but there are a
00:08:13.680
couple of big players that use in
00:08:15.539
production the big one being Google it's
00:08:17.699
being used on YouTube it's being used on
00:08:20.039
GitHub so there are a lot of big
00:08:22.080
companies using it uh yeah I was just
00:08:24.300
going to ask is an angular uh Google yes
00:08:27.240
but classic Google Google has like four
00:08:30.360
different versions of chat apps video
00:08:33.360
call apps they have Google Maps
00:08:36.200
and they have ways at the same time
00:08:38.700
classic Google fashion they just have a
00:08:40.979
ton of competing projects internally I I
00:08:43.440
didn't know like it's they I think also
00:08:45.839
the other thing is Google is a lot more
00:08:47.339
beta rated than some of the other
00:08:49.140
organizations so for example some apple
00:08:51.120
you know it's very much there's a Clear
00:08:53.399
Vision there's a single goal um there's
00:08:56.519
a one overarching product where I do
00:08:59.100
think Google is a bit more like it's a
00:09:01.560
lot of different teams just under one
00:09:03.660
big breath well technically not even
00:09:05.459
Google alphabet and I do
00:09:08.040
I do they serve a bit different purposes
00:09:10.019
one of the critiques against angular
00:09:12.240
though actually is that it's not
00:09:14.459
actually used that extensively by Google
00:09:16.920
itself whether that's a valid critique
00:09:19.560
or not that is something that has been
00:09:21.540
leveraged against it both of them are
00:09:24.000
are by Google
00:09:25.740
um and then the other one Alpine and I I
00:09:28.200
want to mention Alpine because it's kind
00:09:31.080
of a bit in a weird space where it's it
00:09:34.320
has a lot of similarities with
00:09:36.180
Frameworks but it's not a framework per
00:09:38.940
se some people say it's a framework some
00:09:40.620
people say it's not a framework it's
00:09:42.180
kind of interesting but I think it's
00:09:43.920
worth including just because I think it
00:09:47.279
shares a lot of like the same
00:09:49.320
overlapping things that Frameworks do
00:09:51.540
but it's it's very different and it's
00:09:54.420
actually used in a lot of different like
00:09:56.760
in a much different way but I think it's
00:09:58.440
it's interesting to show how a lot of
00:10:00.420
the same concepts are actually
00:10:02.720
approached by other tools and in unique
00:10:05.700
ways but it solves the same problems
00:10:07.800
that framework solved in a much
00:10:09.600
different way but yeah if we'll just
00:10:11.640
look at the stats itself you know so if
00:10:13.800
we look at stars react 200 000 uh it's
00:10:18.000
interesting there was a time where view
00:10:19.440
had more stars than react which is
00:10:22.019
basically think nowadays but we also see
00:10:24.600
you know like svelte has a ton of stars
00:10:27.480
like it's very popular there's a lot of
00:10:29.760
excitement around it but the usage
00:10:32.279
itself is definitely on the lower end
00:10:34.680
it's very hard to conclusively say you
00:10:37.500
know this is the best framework ever
00:10:39.800
popularity also doesn't preclude quality
00:10:43.680
you know in the same way that we can't
00:10:45.420
say that McDonald's is the the golden
00:10:48.060
Pinnacle of The Culinary experience like
00:10:51.300
McDonald's is like best food that you
00:10:54.240
can ever get but it is by far the most
00:10:56.579
popular like we should be cautious of
00:10:58.500
popularity doesn't necessarily equate
00:11:00.180
quality but popularity itself is is
00:11:03.120
something that's worth noting if you're
00:11:05.279
applying for a job you're not
00:11:06.839
necessarily that interested in what is
00:11:08.640
objectively scientifically the best
00:11:10.260
framework you're probably most
00:11:12.120
interested in okay what is the framework
00:11:13.920
that's going to actually open the most
00:11:15.720
doors for me employability wise it
00:11:18.180
doesn't matter if framework X is the
00:11:20.279
best framework and it's been
00:11:21.660
scientifically proven this is the best
00:11:23.040
framework ever but no one uses it I have
00:11:25.440
similar views around like typescript as
00:11:27.480
well not a big fan of typescript we will
00:11:30.240
talk about that script a bit later
00:11:31.380
coming around it's growing on me a bit
00:11:33.839
but it's definitely my least favorite
00:11:36.060
JavaScript superset language or or kind
00:11:38.519
of language that compiles down to
00:11:39.959
JavaScript but it's just so popular that
00:11:42.420
I can't in good faith use anything else
00:11:44.399
just because you know if I want to hire
00:11:46.260
people if I want to apply for jobs all
00:11:48.180
of it is going to be typescript and it's
00:11:49.920
the same with react at this point
00:11:51.180
regardless of what we think about react
00:11:53.040
as mentioned it's it's important to note
00:11:55.500
first and foremost the landscape can
00:11:57.540
change very quickly
00:11:59.100
um those of us that have been around
00:12:01.019
more than a decade kind of know there
00:12:03.240
was a time where it was Unthinkable that
00:12:05.279
Jake where you would ever be like not be
00:12:07.980
main thing that everyone uses to show
00:12:10.980
you guys just how popular jQuery was
00:12:13.620
it's actually built into the Chrome Dev
00:12:16.320
tools if you go or H1 there you go
00:12:19.740
what's this dollar sign this might be
00:12:21.720
before your time but that is effectively
00:12:23.579
how you did jQuery you shouldn't use
00:12:25.740
jQuery today I'm curious actually let me
00:12:28.560
include jQuery interesting at jQuery
00:12:30.959
okay but I guess people don't install
00:12:32.640
jQuery with npm let's do Google Trends
00:12:36.180
here's jQuery so you know it was kind of
00:12:38.339
like add its peak 2012 and like at that
00:12:41.399
time it was almost Unthinkable that I
00:12:43.260
would ever decline as I mentioned it was
00:12:45.660
so popular like it's actually included
00:12:48.060
in the day of tools and a lot of things
00:12:50.700
in JavaScript today was actually star a
00:12:54.060
stolen borrowed whatever term you want
00:12:55.860
to use from jQuery query selector so
00:12:58.500
query selector was taken from jQuery so
00:13:01.680
this is where the discussions come in
00:13:04.139
around you know get element by ID class
00:13:07.320
name all that stuff stuff those are the
00:13:09.000
older ways and so what jQuery did they
00:13:10.980
said you can actually use a CSS selector
00:13:13.560
so we can go you know like H1 and I
00:13:16.500
don't know span or whatever like that so
00:13:18.959
that was actually ported into JavaScript
00:13:21.180
you know by query selector which is
00:13:22.980
maybe also one of the reasons that
00:13:24.899
jQuery declined is a lot of it was
00:13:27.060
actually built built into JavaScript
00:13:28.980
eventually I think as well is the type
00:13:30.959
of things that we're building has
00:13:32.820
changed so dramatically whereas so it's
00:13:34.920
a jQuery isn't doesn't solve that many
00:13:37.380
problems that we have nowadays when
00:13:39.600
building web apps it's very hard to
00:13:41.339
conclusively say which framework is the
00:13:44.220
best but for the purposes of the
00:13:46.019
remainder of this course we are going to
00:13:48.660
be doing reactively just because of
00:13:50.700
usage in terms of popularity the other
00:13:53.160
ones that we are going to cover and
00:13:54.959
we're going to cover them in this order
00:13:56.519
I think I'm gonna actually starting with
00:13:58.680
react I might show you guys a little bit
00:14:00.300
of react now already so starting with
00:14:03.720
react then we're gonna look a bit at
00:14:06.660
Alpine Js because I think it's it's very
00:14:09.300
easy to learn it's a good thing to just
00:14:11.459
include in your tool chain as possible
00:14:14.399
tools that you can use because it's so
00:14:16.380
easy to use and I think it does have a
00:14:18.660
lot of overlapping it solves a lot of
00:14:20.579
the same problems that some of the
00:14:22.200
Frameworks solves so it's worth maybe
00:14:24.000
covering that and I think then I want to
00:14:26.279
return to LIT specifically I I think I
00:14:30.060
want to use that opportunity because we
00:14:31.920
should have a bit of familiar
00:14:33.300
familiarity with little ready to
00:14:36.060
introduce typescript for some of you
00:14:37.860
this might be very exciting because
00:14:39.540
you're like ah I was hoping we could
00:14:41.399
learn typescript because you probably
00:14:42.959
looked at lots of job descriptions said
00:14:45.300
like oh they require typescript and
00:14:47.100
you're like ah I'm gonna have to learn
00:14:48.360
that so we're going to learn that but
00:14:50.639
for some of you that might be very scary
00:14:52.199
because you might have spoken to some
00:14:53.579
people who said like typescript's really
00:14:55.079
hard and it's super hard to learn one of
00:14:57.360
the key things around typescript it's
00:14:59.220
opt-in you can use as much as typescript
00:15:02.220
as you want so it's what is called a
00:15:04.560
superset language which means that all
00:15:07.019
JavaScript is valid typescript if you've
00:15:09.060
ever used something like a SAS so
00:15:11.820
specifically the scss version of SAS SAS
00:15:15.839
is also what's called the superset
00:15:17.220
language in other words regular CSS is
00:15:20.220
100 valid SAS in the same way that
00:15:22.920
regular JavaScript is a hundred percent
00:15:24.899
typescript you can have typescript files
00:15:26.940
you can have an entire typescript
00:15:28.139
project set up only write regular
00:15:30.360
JavaScript and you're going to be fine
00:15:31.860
but by having it set up and having
00:15:34.199
typescript files you do have access to
00:15:37.279
additional things that typescript adds
00:15:40.320
on top of JavaScript and I I do think
00:15:43.320
typescript is increasingly becoming a
00:15:46.620
bigger and bigger requirement if we look
00:15:49.199
at the recent offers in state of
00:15:51.959
developing Nation let me just check the
00:15:54.899
stats I think actually I often joke and
00:15:57.000
say that JavaScript is both the first
00:16:00.300
and third most widely used language
00:16:02.699
because I think typescript's like third
00:16:04.860
or something but typescript is
00:16:06.420
effectively just a different version of
00:16:08.100
JavaScript highly encourage you guys I
00:16:09.899
think I've referenced this state of
00:16:12.540
software development South Africa a ton
00:16:15.260
but I highly encourage you guys to check
00:16:17.820
it out kind of how much you like it
00:16:20.360
javascript's like oh they're down but no
00:16:23.100
surprises how much do you actually use
00:16:25.079
it all the way up there and this is the
00:16:26.940
Paradox of JavaScript it's in terms of
00:16:28.920
usage and this is overall this isn't
00:16:31.079
just front end this is across the world
00:16:33.079
across like in all disciplines which is
00:16:36.060
why we're learning JavaScript the same
00:16:38.220
with react clearly that the biggest
00:16:39.899
reason is just because you're most
00:16:42.060
likely to get a job as a JavaScript
00:16:43.800
developer and you'll see third places
00:16:45.959
typescript if you consider typescript to
00:16:48.000
actually just be JavaScript JavaScript
00:16:49.980
is the first and the third most popular
00:16:52.079
languages by usage and you'll actually
00:16:54.839
see if you look here 2023 and 2022
00:16:57.440
subscript has grown considerably
00:17:00.180
JavaScript has shrunk a little bit uh C
00:17:03.180
sharp has shrunk a little bit python has
00:17:05.400
shrunk a little bit Java shrunk a little
00:17:07.140
bit literally actually almost all
00:17:09.179
languages have shrunk a little bit
00:17:10.559
typescript has grown by a massive margin
00:17:14.579
so I'd actually say a lot of this
00:17:16.619
shrinkage is people who are actually now
00:17:18.959
writing typescript instead of just
00:17:20.640
playing JavaScript it's the only
00:17:22.140
language that has actually increased in
00:17:24.119
usage right so there's our reason for
00:17:25.980
actually throwing in some typescript so
00:17:27.720
you might ask why didn't we just start
00:17:29.940
with typescript if this is the case why
00:17:31.919
well first and foremost because
00:17:33.600
JavaScript is a subset of typescript
00:17:35.580
meaning that any JavaScript you learn is
00:17:37.740
valid typescript and also just diving
00:17:40.140
straight into typescript from day one is
00:17:42.840
is gonna if you thought JavaScript was
00:17:44.460
overwhelming the typescript is a harder
00:17:46.559
language it's more powerful but it is it
00:17:48.960
is harder but we are gonna look at how
00:17:52.020
can you use lit and typescript and we
00:17:54.660
are also gonna obviously let me just
00:17:56.640
include react here as well we are
00:17:58.679
obviously going to talk about react as
00:18:00.660
well and so I just want to quickly chat
00:18:02.580
about react they react if you want to
00:18:05.220
learn react honestly the new you react
00:18:08.340
documentation it was launched this year
00:18:10.200
to me like phenomenal I I think it kind
00:18:13.740
of sits no jokes I think it sets a new
00:18:16.380
bar in terms of how good documentation
00:18:18.600
can be definitely check out the react
00:18:21.000
documentation try and work through the
00:18:23.220
react documentation
00:18:25.020
um before you actually look at YouTube
00:18:27.539
videos or whatever the react
00:18:28.740
documentation itself is phenomenal one
00:18:30.960
thing though you might know about create
00:18:34.200
react app so it's the it's kind of the
00:18:36.900
official way to create react apps but we
00:18:41.340
are going to be using something called
00:18:42.840
Veet instead I don't know if any of you
00:18:45.120
guys have heard about Veet before
00:18:46.320
actually created by Evan you the guy
00:18:49.200
behind view as well he has a he has a he
00:18:52.320
has a weird thing for words that look
00:18:55.440
different than the way you pronounce
00:18:56.880
them everyone started out talking about
00:18:58.980
Vu the new framework
00:19:03.140
and like here everyone started talking
00:19:05.940
about yeah this new this new all tool
00:19:08.400
called White have you used white before
00:19:10.140
and then like people realize like oh no
00:19:12.539
it's actually pronounced beat no jokes
00:19:14.820
that's actually what I've been calling
00:19:16.020
it for like the past year since since
00:19:17.820
even looking at if you want value value
00:19:20.039
for money the main thing you gotta got
00:19:22.500
from the code space uh program is at the
00:19:25.559
very least you're no longer going to be
00:19:26.940
calling this viping you're going to be
00:19:28.200
calling it lead so effect
00:19:31.080
Ive reasons for this why we're not using
00:19:33.900
the official create react app and that
00:19:36.600
is just like there are so many benefits
00:19:38.900
to wheat great react app has stagnated a
00:19:42.960
bit also to the actual acknowledgment of
00:19:46.740
the react team itself so here's a very
00:19:48.780
long post by Dan abramoff who's like one
00:19:51.840
of the core react members
00:19:53.820
um where he effectively says you know
00:19:56.039
um one of the big problems is create
00:19:57.900
react app has stagnated and the reasons
00:20:00.600
for that why it hasn't kept up with some
00:20:03.059
of the other build tools
00:20:05.220
um and you know what are the options you
00:20:07.200
know so you list a couple of options you
00:20:08.760
know create a new framework from scratch
00:20:10.380
deprecate create react app and estate
00:20:13.679
creative template and so forth and so
00:20:15.900
forth but they the key being like even
00:20:17.820
the even the core create react app team
00:20:20.580
says that yeah like we don't know like
00:20:24.600
whether you should use create react app
00:20:27.000
in its current form there are still a
00:20:28.980
lot of people that do it and like
00:20:30.480
there's nothing wrong with it like it's
00:20:31.799
not because these bold tools it's not
00:20:33.720
like your code is going to break or
00:20:35.280
anything it's just it's way slower than
00:20:37.860
like something like wheat because wheat
00:20:40.260
uses es modules whereas create react app
00:20:43.320
is bottom a lot of Legacy stuff like
00:20:45.120
webpack and so forth and wheat also is a
00:20:48.240
lot nicer in terms of plugins so if you
00:20:50.460
want to like include pwas and so forth
00:20:53.280
and so forth whereas create react app is
00:20:55.620
a lot harder to extend so honestly I
00:20:57.720
have a couple of projects that are still
00:20:59.160
using Create react app because it's just
00:21:00.780
such a mission to actually go over to
00:21:03.120
something like Veet and it's probably
00:21:04.320
not worth it but if you're starting a
00:21:06.360
new project today probably encourage
00:21:08.220
using something like beat
00:21:09.840
um instead then also what I want to chat
00:21:12.780
about is I think it's also important to
00:21:15.120
have a discussion on component libraries
00:21:17.640
so we spoke about shoelace because
00:21:19.919
shoelace is a very lightweight it's not
00:21:22.260
necessarily as powerful as some of the
00:21:23.820
ones you get with like the full-on
00:21:25.260
Frameworks um so there are a couple most
00:21:28.320
of the popular ones are built on
00:21:29.820
material design
00:21:31.320
um so you can just use x framework so
00:21:33.780
let's say felt material design or
00:21:36.419
angular material design view material
00:21:39.480
design I think it's beautify or
00:21:41.220
beautifies the view one well actually
00:21:43.320
material design is by Google so they
00:21:45.480
have an official like angular version
00:21:47.760
angular svelt has material oh yeah the
00:21:51.360
big ones are effectively and there's a
00:21:53.520
new one that's Mantine or Manatee
00:21:56.640
Mantine this one is has a lot of
00:21:58.980
popularity it's coming up in terms of
00:22:01.440
usage like hands down how people are
00:22:04.380
still using material UI which I also
00:22:07.380
just use chances are if you come across
00:22:09.419
a react project that's probably using
00:22:11.159
material UI but the other ones are and
00:22:13.860
I'm not a big fan of and people use it
00:22:16.380
mad team as well as is a very new one
00:22:20.039
but the kind of the Workhorse is still a
00:22:22.260
material UI there's a couple and I I
00:22:24.840
will link to them do you why do we use
00:22:27.059
these for the same reason that even
00:22:28.620
these companies use them because first
00:22:30.840
and foremost they are able to be
00:22:33.480
extended in and this is also why
00:22:35.580
material design is so popular compared
00:22:37.620
to something like bootstrap so there is
00:22:39.480
a react bootstrap and then the great
00:22:41.940
thing about material design and while
00:22:43.799
you'll find while you you'd find
00:22:45.659
actually that material design some
00:22:47.520
material design based component library
00:22:49.380
is usually the most popular component
00:22:51.419
library for any framework is because it
00:22:53.400
is really easy to extend it's built to
00:22:55.500
be extended I I think I have that
00:22:57.720
material studies but yeah so here's an
00:23:00.480
example on material design itself which
00:23:02.520
shows you kind of how you can look at
00:23:05.760
different styles
00:23:07.320
um using the exact same Library it's
00:23:09.900
very extensible you can definitely
00:23:12.059
extend it to uh I use it and almost all
00:23:16.799
projects that I work on so I'm no longer
00:23:19.380
actively working on it but when I did
00:23:21.120
work at uh umazi we use material UI
00:23:25.440
there we also use it at palmatrix as
00:23:28.559
well uh Although our landing page still
00:23:32.159
needs a bit of love enter both yeah so
00:23:35.340
um it's definitely the one I kind of
00:23:37.140
spill in regardless because it allows
00:23:39.360
you to just move so quickly there's no
00:23:41.100
reason why should be creating your own
00:23:43.020
buttons and stuff from scratch the new
00:23:45.240
version of material UI uses something
00:23:47.640
called emotion so there's this other
00:23:50.220
thing called styled components that you
00:23:52.380
might have heard about so emotion kind
00:23:54.000
of checks the concept of style
00:23:55.620
components even further uh Duane I don't
00:23:57.960
know if this is probably what you were
00:23:58.980
referring to yeah it's yeah so it's
00:24:01.380
exactly the same styled components it's
00:24:03.720
not a component Library styled
00:24:05.700
components is a way to write CSS so I
00:24:09.659
still use style components in a lot of
00:24:11.880
framework in a lot of the projects that
00:24:13.980
I work on emotion has kind of overtaken
00:24:16.799
style components uh purely just because
00:24:19.320
it is it has a lot more flexibility and
00:24:22.500
then you get a style components and so
00:24:24.780
material UI uses emotion you'll see
00:24:27.299
there's part of the installation of the
00:24:29.220
installations so that's what you use to
00:24:31.260
extend it as well but the style
00:24:32.880
components is probably what you refer to
00:24:34.500
yeah so it's just a way to write CSS
00:24:37.860
easily in react so you can have the CSS
00:24:40.980
in your your files themselves without a
00:24:43.200
separate CSS file so I think over here
00:24:45.179
we'll just pull in the regular
00:24:46.620
JavaScript version of react but wheat is
00:24:49.320
like effortless in terms of setting up
00:24:51.299
typescript
00:24:52.500
um sure back in the day maybe four or
00:24:54.299
five years ago you are was such a pain
00:24:56.460
setting up typescript it was one of the
00:24:58.980
big reasons why a lot of people didn't
00:25:00.960
use typescript is because it was such a
00:25:03.360
pain like setting it up of way back
00:25:05.640
um getting it playing nicely even back
00:25:08.039
then eslint didn't work of typescript so
00:25:10.620
you needed a specific typescript linting
00:25:12.840
oh and it didn't play nice with lots of
00:25:15.120
other tools beats went a long way in
00:25:18.419
actually making typescript like really
00:25:20.640
accessible and making it literally as
00:25:22.860
easy as just it asks you do you want
00:25:24.720
typescript or not and you just say yes
00:25:26.279
or no and that is it so the others I
00:25:28.620
want to talk about is obviously view or
00:25:31.380
Vu as everyone called it in the
00:25:33.480
beginning view is quite popular and the
00:25:36.480
reason why view is so popular is no
00:25:39.720
jokes it has a really really amazing
00:25:42.480
developer experience so despite Justin's
00:25:45.779
experience with it of
00:25:47.400
the Frameworks it's it's it's one of the
00:25:50.279
popular ones that have the easiest
00:25:52.140
learning curve that is the easiest to
00:25:54.299
work with and and the reason for that is
00:25:57.059
because it really goes out of its way to
00:26:00.299
abstract away gross and confusing Parts
00:26:03.299
about JavaScript it kind of hides all of
00:26:05.520
that away and which means like you kind
00:26:08.580
of use like with react you work a lot
00:26:11.580
closer to JavaScript you use a lot of
00:26:14.520
JavaScript logic in your code whereas
00:26:16.860
view who hides away a bit of the gross
00:26:18.960
parts of JavaScript because of this
00:26:20.940
unfortunately the reality is that view
00:26:24.059
is less flexible because it needs to
00:26:27.120
make assumptions about the context that
00:26:29.460
we will use it in and what is underneath
00:26:31.980
it you know so we spoke about you know
00:26:33.840
things like encapsulation polymorphism
00:26:36.000
all those things obviously the more the
00:26:38.880
the the more assumptions you make about
00:26:41.220
how something is going to be used the
00:26:43.020
less flexible it is one of the trades
00:26:45.059
off of you is that it is less flexible
00:26:47.340
all so in other words with react so
00:26:49.860
react doesn't even the core react
00:26:51.900
Library doesn't even assume that you're
00:26:54.179
going to be using it in the Dom you know
00:26:56.039
you need a completely separate Library
00:26:57.539
you need to react Dom to actually use
00:27:00.179
the to bind it with the Dom but you also
00:27:02.100
get react native you get react or VR you
00:27:06.000
can even use react to write music so you
00:27:08.640
can bind it with anything react is just
00:27:10.799
a way to express a tree-like structure
00:27:13.500
like a virtual Dom and then how that
00:27:15.779
virtual Dom is translated to something
00:27:17.880
as where the bindings come in view very
00:27:21.480
clearly assumes you're going to be using
00:27:23.400
it in a browser you're going to be using
00:27:25.020
it with JavaScript and you're going to
00:27:26.880
building an a web app with it beyond
00:27:29.220
that it's very hard to extend real there
00:27:32.880
were there was a library at some point
00:27:34.919
called view native plot twist view
00:27:37.260
native was actually built on top of
00:27:39.000
react native so it was actually just a
00:27:41.700
way like like it actually just tried to
00:27:43.620
get react native to work with you didn't
00:27:46.080
turn out that well so have used very
00:27:48.779
hard to extend if you want to turn it
00:27:50.279
into a native app and so forth whereas
00:27:52.799
react it's very easy even something like
00:27:54.840
angular not as flexible as react but
00:27:57.720
like you stall you get like ionic and
00:27:59.940
all those things it's still very easy to
00:28:02.159
push it to other platforms and so forth
00:28:04.140
so which is also you know like within
00:28:06.120
the world of view you'll find you know
00:28:08.220
next
00:28:09.179
um there's another one called gridsum
00:28:10.799
which hasn't really caught up paid to so
00:28:13.200
if we look at meta Frameworks and we can
00:28:14.640
speak about meta Frameworks in a second
00:28:16.260
when you look at react there's a ton of
00:28:18.120
meta Frameworks there's like next
00:28:19.620
there's Gatsby there's remix
00:28:22.799
um there's one called Blitz there's
00:28:25.500
another one called Redwood there's a ton
00:28:27.960
of metal and that's just because react
00:28:29.640
is so flexible you can actually just
00:28:31.740
compose it in whatever way you want and
00:28:33.960
whereas bu is a lot more like because it
00:28:37.020
makes assumptions and and it makes those
00:28:39.179
assumptions in order to make the
00:28:41.220
experience better so it can make
00:28:42.960
assumptions about what are the gross
00:28:44.400
parts that it's going to hide whereas
00:28:46.020
react doesn't do that meaning you need
00:28:48.000
to deal with a lot of the gross parts
00:28:49.320
around JavaScript in the early days
00:28:51.480
people criticized react for a lot
00:28:53.940
without actually realizing that some of
00:28:56.039
the gross Parts is actually JavaScript
00:28:58.020
itself it's not react that's gross it's
00:29:00.480
just like react doesn't hide that
00:29:02.220
grossness away specifically with the
00:29:04.559
early class based API and so forth where
00:29:07.799
you had we had to bind your methods and
00:29:11.279
stuff like that the other one I want to
00:29:13.020
talk about is angular angular is kind of
00:29:15.000
like the batteries included framework it
00:29:17.580
comes with everything there is a angular
00:29:20.460
way to do everything most of the time
00:29:22.980
you won't work directly with the fetch
00:29:24.960
API you won't work directly with like
00:29:27.419
whatever whatever all of that stuff
00:29:29.520
there's an angular module that you
00:29:31.500
import that does kind of that for you
00:29:33.720
people often joke and say that angular
00:29:35.700
is a front-end framework written by
00:29:38.820
back-end Developers for back-end
00:29:40.440
developers to a certain degree yes
00:29:42.539
because it is meant to just be like
00:29:45.480
batteries included whatever you want you
00:29:47.580
don't need to write a lot of JavaScript
00:29:49.080
you just pull in the parts that you want
00:29:51.120
and you plug it in it's almost like
00:29:52.559
WordPress you know
00:29:54.299
um you know there's just like official
00:29:55.860
plugins and whatever you plug in and you
00:29:57.720
get what you want meaning that angular
00:29:59.580
is is a great library for Enterprise
00:30:01.740
teams angular is a great Library where
00:30:04.080
you have a big like your apps are or FNB
00:30:07.799
or I don't know like some big Enterprise
00:30:10.159
and you have a lot of developers and
00:30:12.419
only a small part of that is Javascript
00:30:14.100
developers but if you want everyone to
00:30:16.080
contribute to the actual code base
00:30:18.120
without having to understand JavaScript
00:30:19.919
and that well angle is a good fit there
00:30:22.140
nowadays we actually see more of those
00:30:25.080
companies actually going to react worlds
00:30:28.440
so I think there's an interesting
00:30:29.760
conversation to be had there but the
00:30:31.860
goal but angular is very clearly for
00:30:33.720
Enterprise I wouldn't necessarily build
00:30:36.600
a startup with angular or you know
00:30:39.480
create my own little tools or whatever
00:30:41.340
with angular I might consider view or
00:30:44.100
react um angular I think is for a lot
00:30:46.440
more like yeah a big team because Angela
00:30:49.380
is very opinionated it has a very clear
00:30:51.299
way this is how you do things so it's
00:30:53.700
very nice when you have a big team and
00:30:55.980
you just want everyone to have like an
00:30:58.500
on-rails experience and that's how you
00:31:00.840
do a fetching call this is how you get
00:31:02.760
data from the server this is how you
00:31:04.860
actually style your components whereas
00:31:07.140
in the world of react when it's like oh
00:31:09.480
how do you start your components okay
00:31:11.520
well there's these 30 libraries none of
00:31:13.620
them are actually maintained by that
00:31:15.000
react team itself it's all third party
00:31:16.820
which one do you want and maybe next
00:31:19.140
year there's going to be a different one
00:31:20.279
which people are going to choose that
00:31:22.020
they can use angular you get a lot more
00:31:23.700
certainty you get a lot more like this
00:31:25.500
is the official angular way and that's
00:31:28.140
how everyone used to do it that's why
00:31:29.940
I'm not that big of a fan of angular
00:31:31.860
myself but it's just because of the type
00:31:33.480
of projects that I build so then
00:31:35.580
obviously most of these very very much
00:31:39.179
rely on node um because you know at some
00:31:42.240
point you need some type of old step to
00:31:45.600
be able to reduce some of the complexity
00:31:47.059
at some point in order to get a certain
00:31:50.760
level of abstract you need to bring in a
00:31:53.039
ball step there's only so much you can
00:31:54.779
abstract in the JavaScript runtime
00:31:56.640
itself while the code is running at some
00:31:59.100
point you need to be able to say okay I
00:32:00.899
like this thing needs to actually be
00:32:02.580
able to change files move files around
00:32:05.279
rewrite pieces of files and so forth
00:32:08.640
um you know so and you know and so what
00:32:10.740
read effectively also does it abstracts
00:32:13.380
a lot of that away for us you should be
00:32:16.140
somewhat familiar with node already in a
00:32:18.899
node is effectively the way to run
00:32:21.840
JavaScript let me just get the node logo
00:32:24.000
somewhere um it's effectively the way to
00:32:26.700
run JavaScript in other environments
00:32:29.100
beyond the browser so what a lot of
00:32:31.500
these do is they by means of wheat so V
00:32:34.559
does kind of upsets all of this up for
00:32:36.539
you allows you to run JavaScript outside
00:32:39.720
of the actual code itself so you use
00:32:42.299
JavaScript to modify your files
00:32:45.480
um add polyfolds to do what's called
00:32:47.940
like code splitting so you're it's not
00:32:50.520
just one big Javascript file things like
00:32:53.520
routing all of that stuff so we're going
00:32:56.039
to spend a bit of time just looking at
00:32:57.539
that we're not going to go into things
00:33:00.000
like Express and so forth
00:33:02.580
um I think that is a bit beyond the
00:33:04.500
scope of this so we're not going to look
00:33:06.059
at spinning up a node server using
00:33:08.279
mongodb and all of that stuff and you
00:33:10.919
can look at that if you want
00:33:12.659
um but I think it's it's important that
00:33:14.100
we just maybe clear around that so when
00:33:15.899
you hear node you understand that we're
00:33:17.760
only using node for a specific purpose
00:33:19.740
but you can use node for loads of
00:33:22.080
purposes including actually running a
00:33:24.179
server in the same way that you would
00:33:25.559
run a PHP server or a python server or
00:33:27.720
whatever you can actually use node to
00:33:29.399
run a JavaScript server so we're not
00:33:31.380
going to be touching on that part but so
00:33:33.480
then there is spell and so the reason
00:33:35.880
why I spelled the JavaScript Community
00:33:38.100
darling at the moment is because first
00:33:40.679
and foremost it's kind of upcoming and
00:33:42.360
there's always excitement about
00:33:43.440
something that's kind of new and
00:33:44.880
upcoming you know compared to something
00:33:46.140
like a react reactors really old I don't
00:33:48.360
think people realize how old reactive
00:33:49.919
we're kind of almost you know two
00:33:51.779
decades now into react you know we
00:33:54.179
started seeing react already like in
00:33:56.640
2010 around that time so I think people
00:33:59.340
realize how old react is but so what's
00:34:01.799
well does what's interesting it says in
00:34:04.980
instead of actually so all these
00:34:07.140
Frameworks do the abstractions in the
00:34:10.260
JavaScript runtime itself so there is
00:34:13.080
you know uh there's a react you know dot
00:34:16.379
you know create element or whatever so
00:34:18.300
these are actual libraries that you can
00:34:21.359
actually you know I think there's also
00:34:23.339
like a you can go like new view or
00:34:26.040
whatever you can actually call these
00:34:28.320
Frameworks in the JavaScript environment
00:34:30.418
themselves they live in the runtime
00:34:33.000
um when someone opens your site and
00:34:34.560
Boots up the framework spelled does
00:34:36.540
something interesting where it actually
00:34:37.859
says svelt is a bold time only framework
00:34:40.800
meaning that spelled spits out playing
00:34:44.040
JavaScript there's no spell anything in
00:34:46.739
there actual runtime itself it's a way
00:34:50.040
to write your code and solve a lot of
00:34:53.099
the framework problems and then have a
00:34:55.440
smelt compiler take that code and turn
00:34:57.900
it for you into plain JavaScript which
00:34:59.700
is also one of the reasons why spelled
00:35:01.260
this so fast and performant there are
00:35:03.420
also some trade-offs by not having an
00:35:05.640
actual framework runtime that you run in
00:35:08.220
the browser itself personally for me
00:35:10.560
it's kind of I'm a bit hesitant to say
00:35:12.240
this because everyone's just oh it's so
00:35:14.339
amazing honestly I'm not that big of a
00:35:16.079
fan I I don't enjoy it that much it's
00:35:18.359
fun I guess like to me the trade offset
00:35:21.060
makes to be able to realize this
00:35:23.220
architecture I don't know it feels to me
00:35:26.040
a bit too magical there's too much stuff
00:35:28.560
hidden whereas you know with react you
00:35:31.619
can effectively like literally interface
00:35:33.780
with the react framework directly in the
00:35:35.820
client side you can go in your console
00:35:37.260
and you can like actually look at the
00:35:39.240
react object and do something with it um
00:35:41.520
but you know that's just me we'll we'll
00:35:43.320
see how the next couple of years pan out
00:35:45.359
there's a lot of excitement around felt
00:35:47.820
and and to be honest there's a lot of
00:35:49.140
things that I've kind of come around to
00:35:51.000
or that have grown on me you know
00:35:52.859
typescript being one of them I know
00:35:54.300
enjoying typescript more but nowadays
00:35:56.520
than I used to yeah as mentioned it's
00:35:58.320
grown on me so don't take this as as me
00:36:00.900
saying self substance you felt like it's
00:36:02.940
good I like it it's just maybe it's just
00:36:04.619
been over hyped and like I'm like it's
00:36:06.960
okay-ish I guess we'll see what happens
00:36:09.119
there so then what we want to do is now
00:36:12.660
that we have all of this we want to
00:36:14.460
start looking at one of the big things
00:36:16.740
that these allow us to do is to handle
00:36:20.040
concurrency in asynchrony and those
00:36:23.520
things are really hard to do with just
00:36:25.200
plain JavaScript because as as mentioned
00:36:27.900
you know like the Dom itself very much
00:36:30.060
built on an oop model like about these
00:36:33.060
objects and you interface with this
00:36:34.800
object and you imperatively update it
00:36:36.660
and change it it's very hard to reason
00:36:39.420
about when you have concurrency
00:36:41.339
happening and this is one of the parts
00:36:42.960
where op struggles about you know like
00:36:44.940
let's say we have an H1 tag here and
00:36:48.180
let's just say you know it's just like a
00:36:49.859
random piece of text it's a Dom node and
00:36:52.560
you maybe have three concurrent things
00:36:54.240
happening let's say index DB maybe do a
00:36:57.599
API call you maybe do another API call
00:37:00.480
wait for uh user event so these are all
00:37:03.960
concurrent things that can happen in
00:37:05.940
parallel so if they mutate that thing
00:37:08.280
given that they can happen at different
00:37:09.900
times how do we actually manage this in
00:37:13.260
a meaningful way because with the purely
00:37:15.480
oop approach and this is mutable you
00:37:18.359
know you override it the clarity of a
00:37:20.460
functional approach you take the current
00:37:22.320
H1 and you turn it into something new
00:37:24.599
you don't just completely override it
00:37:26.520
it's a bit easier to maintain in that
00:37:29.460
manner problem is that this isn't the
00:37:32.760
way that the Dom works you know the Dom
00:37:35.280
very much relies on an oop approach you
00:37:38.099
know you can mutate things and it's
00:37:39.720
objects that you mutate a lot of these
00:37:42.060
Frameworks by just giving us a
00:37:43.980
declarative way to actually like
00:37:46.619
interface face width of you and our Dom
00:37:49.020
and makes the questions around
00:37:51.359
concurrency and things happening in
00:37:53.220
parallel much easier you're not actually
00:37:55.260
going and overriding things you are
00:37:57.359
effectively just setting so you have
00:37:59.220
your data setting that data binding that
00:38:03.060
data as the source of what gets shown in
00:38:05.099
the H1 so the only thing you need to
00:38:06.960
reason about is how do these concurrent
00:38:09.119
things influence the data you don't
00:38:11.220
manually go and update without knowing
00:38:13.500
okay what other things let's say then
00:38:15.240
someone else comes and they add another
00:38:16.680
concurrent thing here and sometimes this
00:38:19.079
concurrent thing resolves sooner than
00:38:21.359
the others so sometimes so you have a
00:38:23.460
race condition where sometimes it shows
00:38:25.320
one piece of text but you reload it then
00:38:27.180
it's something else and then there's
00:38:28.859
something else changing the color but
00:38:30.599
when it's disabled it can also be gray
00:38:32.579
you know so you have all these things
00:38:34.880
mutating the single thing and you can't
00:38:37.440
keep track of where all those changes
00:38:39.480
are coming from you know so it's hard
00:38:41.160
enough keeping track of all these
00:38:42.720
mutations it's a completely different
00:38:44.760
ball game when these mutations or happen
00:38:47.700
in parallel and they don't always happen
00:38:49.560
even in the same order sometimes
00:38:51.119
something loads faster than something
00:38:52.680
else sometimes you know this thing fails
00:38:55.200
sometimes this thing is a cached result
00:38:57.599
instead of the actual server sometimes
00:39:00.119
you're logged in sometimes you're not
00:39:01.380
logged in you can imagine it's a mess
00:39:03.260
luckily and this is one of the places
00:39:05.640
where Frameworks really shine is
00:39:07.320
allowing us to handle concurrency
00:39:10.140
um which is also one of the big
00:39:11.820
differences between you know a web app
00:39:14.520
and a website honestly I actually think
00:39:17.940
that a lot of these Frameworks are
00:39:19.800
overkill for traditional web pages
00:39:22.020
digital brochure type sites there are a
00:39:25.500
lot of really great tools I'm maybe just
00:39:28.140
going to mention them Astro Astro is
00:39:30.900
phenomenal you can actually use little
00:39:33.540
bits of these Frameworks in Astro
00:39:35.820
another one that's really great by a guy
00:39:38.579
called Zach Leatherman is 11t and so
00:39:42.900
they are really great tools for spitting
00:39:46.320
out an HTML page once it's spread out
00:39:48.599
there isn't really much that changes
00:39:50.280
like here's the content this is great
00:39:52.380
for like kind of things that would
00:39:53.700
traditionally be built with like
00:39:54.900
WordPress or whatever whereas when I
00:39:57.060
talk about web apps we're talking about
00:39:58.140
things happening like you're adding
00:39:59.520
something you're deleting something
00:40:00.540
removing something editing something and
00:40:02.579
so this is where these these boys come
00:40:04.740
in so but specifically obviously we're
00:40:06.599
going to look at react because we don't
00:40:09.000
have time I might lightly touch on how
00:40:11.640
you handle these type of things with the
00:40:13.680
other Frameworks but for our purposes
00:40:15.480
we're gonna look primarily how do you
00:40:17.099
handle a synchrony with react what with
00:40:20.700
the final piece of asynchronous behavior
00:40:23.280
that we're going to look at is API API
00:40:25.859
calls so you know Json placeholder
00:40:28.560
actually requesting data from another
00:40:30.780
server so let me show you an example
00:40:32.760
some of you might have already worked
00:40:34.859
with this and counted this a bit well
00:40:36.599
let me go to parliamentary so what I'm
00:40:39.119
currently working on if you have a look
00:40:41.040
here in the network tab we're busy doing
00:40:43.560
a massive refactor just disregard this
00:40:45.660
like it's a bit of a mess you'll see
00:40:47.880
that a lot of the API calls
00:40:50.339
um actually happen in the background so
00:40:52.980
you'll see there's like a split second
00:40:54.359
it's like blank loading data and then it
00:40:56.640
starts requesting so it shows you a page
00:40:58.800
immediately it doesn't show you like a
00:41:00.720
white page white page and then all of a
00:41:02.400
sudden content so it shows you it
00:41:04.020
incrementally loads things from the
00:41:05.820
server as they come in you'll see that
00:41:08.099
for example you know like the user plan
00:41:09.960
here's all the information around the
00:41:12.000
user plan kind of notification and
00:41:14.220
settings and and so forth like it's
00:41:16.560
quite common moment to have your web app
00:41:18.900
separate from your data have your data
00:41:21.000
live somewhere on a server and you just
00:41:22.859
interact with that server and this is
00:41:24.780
also where this term you know a single
00:41:26.520
page app which you're also going to be
00:41:27.839
covering about you don't you only have a
00:41:29.760
single page
00:41:30.900
um so you know you have an index.html
00:41:33.000
page and all that happens is the data on
00:41:35.520
that page just changes we want to show
00:41:37.619
something new you actually just request
00:41:39.240
something new from the server and so
00:41:40.920
because of the scope of what we're going
00:41:42.720
to be covering we're just going to be
00:41:43.800
looking at get requests so how to get
00:41:46.200
information from the server but you know
00:41:48.660
like there's loads of other requests you
00:41:50.520
can actually send stuff save stuff on
00:41:52.560
the server so you know for example on
00:41:54.900
here you know how does it know that if I
00:41:57.180
reload why doesn't it just clear
00:41:59.160
everything and it's because it sends it
00:42:01.020
to a server it saves it in a database as
00:42:03.540
I'm working and then when I reload the
00:42:05.640
page it pulls it again from the database
00:42:07.920
so we're going to be looking at some of
00:42:09.180
that stuff as you grow in your career
00:42:10.980
you're probably going to have to become
00:42:12.119
a bit more competent with doing post
00:42:13.859
requests put requests those type of
00:42:15.720
things but I think like as a junior
00:42:18.420
starting out just being able to pull
00:42:20.820
information from a server is like
00:42:23.220
sufficient and you can even build your
00:42:25.140
own things with something like let's say
00:42:27.359
high graph I'll maybe touch on uh
00:42:30.000
graphql a little bit as well and so this
00:42:32.220
is effectively like a headless CMS so
00:42:35.400
you kind of just manage all the info
00:42:37.560
here and then you hit an API so if you
00:42:40.440
are setting up a website for a client or
00:42:43.560
whatever you can just have them use high
00:42:46.140
graph to kind of update the information
00:42:48.060
it's very much like a WordPress that
00:42:50.640
WordPress dashboard and then you just
00:42:52.980
hit the API here is an example of a
00:42:56.119
e-commerce store and you actually upload
00:42:58.619
and maintain the products and update the
00:43:00.720
products on high graph and then you just
00:43:03.060
pull it down on your actual site to show
00:43:05.339
to users and so all of that is done by
00:43:07.800
the fetch API which we will cover at the
00:43:10.740
end so fetch API allows you to actually
00:43:13.140
get information from other places on the
00:43:15.180
internet
00:43:15.960
Um this can be your own stuff so let's
00:43:17.760
say you want to build an app that uses
00:43:19.440
the weather API you sometimes need to
00:43:21.420
pay so you get a bit of free stuff and
00:43:24.300
then you just get this back from the
00:43:26.460
server and you can actually build your
00:43:27.720
app around this then you can use
00:43:29.099
something like react or whatever to turn
00:43:31.020
this into app information here's an
00:43:33.119
example I might actually show in one of
00:43:34.740
the sessions so s comes a push you know
00:43:37.140
very topical at the moment they actually
00:43:39.060
have a API and I think maybe you can
00:43:41.520
play around with it a bit I actually
00:43:43.020
know um Harman and Dan quite well
00:43:46.200
um and I'll maybe even be able to
00:43:48.000
organize a free API for us and that we
00:43:50.640
can play around with
