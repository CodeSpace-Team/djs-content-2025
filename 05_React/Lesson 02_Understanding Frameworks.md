### Lesson 1: Understanding Frameworks

IMAGES TO BE ADDED

#### The Framework Landscape: Focusing on React
In the vast ecosystem of JavaScript frameworks, React stands out due to its widespread adoption and versatility. While many frameworks offer unique advantages, React's dominance in the industry is undeniable. Choosing to focus on React is strategic, aiming to equip learners with skills that are in high demand. However, exposure to alternative frameworks is beneficial for a well-rounded understanding and flexibility in the tech field. This approach encourages a "T-shaped" learning path—deep knowledge in a particular area (React) while maintaining a broad understanding of related technologies.

In this course, we'll primarily focus on React.js due to its popularity and employability. Still, the ever-changing JavaScript landscape necessitates adaptability and understanding of the broader ecosystem.

While honing React skills, comparisons to other frameworks will help deepen understanding and encourage exploration. A strong foundation in programming concepts is crucial for a successful career in software development.

While most JavaScript frameworks attempt to solve the same problem, they all have unique strengths, weaknesses, and use cases. As you can imagine, selecting a framework that is always the correct choice in all circumstances is challenging. Furthermore, the above is made worse by selecting many smaller, more specialised libraries and tools available with single or multiple frameworks.

Even if it was possible to determine the “best” framework for all circumstances scientifically, the rapid pace at which the world of JavaScript is still developing means such an evaluation would probably only remain relevant for a specific time window.

The bad news is that a basic understanding of the framework and JavaScript landscape remains a moving target, which requires continual effort and research into different toolchains. The good news is that as someone seeking to enter the industry, it is relatively easy for you to catch up with established practitioners in terms of learning tooling and frameworks - since the tools we use to create JavaScript-based software today are still relatively new.

However, it is essential to remember that more than merely learning tools and frameworks are needed for you to grow in your career. You must exercise discipline and discernment regarding more profound programming concepts that help you make meaningful decisions when building software.

At this point, your question may be, which framework will we primarily focus on in this course? Both the answer and reasoning are straightforward. First, we will spend most of our time looking at React.js, a popular framework maintained by the team behind Facebook. Since this program aims to achieve a minimum of entry-level employability, we will focus on React, the most widely used framework. Therefore, numbers alone are the most commonly required skill in most JavaScript positions.


Looking at the number of downloads from NPM in the last month (May 2023), we can see React clearly in the lead, hovering around 20 million downloads, with the runner-up Vue at only about 4 million downloads.

It is important to note that currently (May 2023), React is the 8th most popular library on GitHub across all categories. Furthermore, in the latest international State of JavaScript survey, React retains an unprecedentedly high level of satisfaction, which is relatively uncommon since most tools dip in satisfaction rating over time as they become more popular (since people are increasingly being forced to use it).
 
It would be tough to overstate the ubiquity of React.js in modern JavaScript development, and for that reason alone, we will be spending most of our time talking about React.


However, there is a catch: as mentioned, JavaScript is a rapidly changing landscape. A mere four years ago, Vue outranked React regarding Github's popularity. At the same time, due to internal disputes at Facebook, the actual licensing of the React framework was changed to a more restrictive license. At the time, several big organisations threatened or made active plans to transition away from React, resulting in Facebook reverting their decision to make the full MIT open-source license available again.


While this proved to merely be a short stumble on the way to market dominance in retrospect, several developers believed this to be the end of React itself. Furthermore, those in the industry for more than a decade now can attest to the idea of various tools like jQuery that, at the height of their popularity, seemed impossible to master. For example, jQuery was so popular that it is still included in Chrome Devtools automatically using the global $ variable.

The point is that not only is it irresponsible to build one’s entire career around a specific technology, but understanding how the particular tool fits into the broader ecosystem of JavaScript frameworks will make you a better React developer.

This means that while we will primarily focus on learning React, we will spend time in each lesson comparing it to other frameworks to understand React itself better. However, this should also serve as an essential springboard for researching and exploring alternative frameworks in your own time.

#### Importance of Fundamentals
Before diving deep into any specific framework, understanding the underlying language—JavaScript, in this case—is crucial. This foundational knowledge ensures a comprehensive grasp of how frameworks operate, enhancing problem-solving skills and adaptability across different technologies. Starting with a framework might offer a shortcut to building applications, but it could limit career growth and adaptability in the fast-evolving tech landscape.

At the beginning of our journey into JavaScript frameworks, it's essential to recognize these tools as abstractions designed to streamline and enhance web development processes. Frameworks empower developers to create complex and interactive web applications efficiently, offering pre-written code, templates, and libraries to handle common tasks.

This introduction serves as a stepping stone into the world of JavaScript frameworks, emphasizing the importance of a solid foundation in JavaScript and the rationale behind focusing on React. The journey through frameworks is not just about learning to use tools but about understanding the principles that guide their design and application in real-world scenarios.
