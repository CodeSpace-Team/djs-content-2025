# Lecture Notes: Creating a UI Framework

This lesson covers the essentials of creating a user interface (UI) framework focusing on key concepts like immutability, pure functions, and separating data from behaviour. By adhering to these principles, we aim to write code more declaratively, focusing on the "what" rather than the "how". This approach simplifies debugging, enhances code readability, and reduces complexity.

When restricting ourselves to immutability, pure functions and separation of data from behaviour, we can write code more declaratively. This helps us focus on the "what" rather than the "how‚Äù, which significantly reduces complexity, increases readability and makes our code easier to debug.

## Core Concepts Explained

- **Immutability**: Ensures that data structures cannot be modified once created. This leads to safer code, preventing unintended side effects.
- **Pure Functions**: Functions that, given the same input, will always return the same output and do not cause any side effects.
- **Separation of Data from Behaviour**: Decouples data (the state of your application) from the operations (behaviours) that can be performed on that data. This enhances modularity and reusability.

## Building the UI Framework

1. **Starting with Components**: Components are the building blocks of our UI. However, managing components in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) can get unwieldy due to large codebases and repetition. By abstracting component creation, we can focus on the essentials.

2. **Creating Abstractions**: We introduce a utility function, `createComponent`, that simplifies component creation. This function encapsulates common tasks like attaching shadow DOM, adding event listeners, and connecting components to a global state (if necessary).

3. **Example Implementation**: A simple example is demonstrated where a component is created using the `createComponent` utility. This approach abstracts away the repetitive tasks, allowing us to focus on defining the component's behaviour and presentation.

4. **Declarative UI Updates**: A key goal of our framework is to enable declarative updates to the UI. This means describing what the UI should look like for a given state, without worrying about how to transition the UI from one state to another. This approach is central to functional programming and modern UI frameworks.

5. **Advantages of Our Approach**: By adopting immutability, pure functions, and separation of data from behaviour, our framework reduces complexity and makes the codebase more manageable. It aligns with functional programming principles, leading to more predictable and easier-to-debug code.


Creating a UI framework from scratch helps illuminate the underlying mechanics of more complex libraries and frameworks. While this exercise is educational, in real-world scenarios, it's advisable to leverage existing frameworks for their robustness, community support, and ongoing development. Understanding these core concepts, however, empowers developers to make informed decisions about selecting and using these tools effectively.

Remember, the goal of this lesson is not just to learn how to build a UI framework but to understand the principles that make our code more efficient, readable, and maintainable.
