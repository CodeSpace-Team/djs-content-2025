### Lesson: Polymorphism

Polymorphism is a concept in programming that allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. The term originates from the Greek words 'poly' (meaning 'many') and 'morph' (meaning 'form'), thus polymorphism means 'many forms'. It allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions.

Critical to creating abstractions that scale well, is the concept of “polymorphism”. In this lesson, we will reflect on how we have used polymorphism until now and introduce a new type of polymorphism, called “parametric polymorphism”, as an additional tool when creating abstractions.

#### Understanding Polymorphism

1. **Definition:** Polymorphism enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types). In programming, it allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.

2. **Types of Polymorphism:**
   - **Ad Hoc Polymorphism:** Achieved through method overloading or operator overloading.
   - **Parametric Polymorphism:** Allows a function or a data type to be written generically, so it can handle values uniformly without depending on their type.
   - **Subtype Polymorphism (or Inclusion Polymorphism):** Allows a function to be written to take objects of a superclass type, but also work with objects of any subclass types.

3. **Benefits:**
   - **Flexibility:** It offers flexibility by allowing interfaces to specify only what is common among objects.
   - **Maintainability:** Makes the code more manageable and easier to understand.
   - **Reusability:** Promotes code reusability through a common interface for multiple implementations.

4. **Examples in Programming:**
   - **Function Overloading:** The same function name can perform different tasks based on input parameters.
   - **Operator Overloading:** The same operator behaves differently based on operands.
   - **Interface Implementation:** Different classes can implement the same interface in different ways.

#### Implementing Polymorphism

1. **In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
   - Use inheritance and method overriding to achieve polymorphism. A superclass reference variable can refer to a subclass object.
   - Implement interfaces to allow different classes to be treated through a single interface.

2. **Functional Programming:**
   - Higher-order functions that take functions as parameters or return them as results can exhibit polymorphism by operating on data of different types.

#### Best Practices

1. **Use Polymorphism Wisely:** While polymorphism promotes flexibility and reusability, overuse or incorrect use can lead to complexity. It's important to balance its use to keep code understandable and maintainable.

2. **Understand the Type of Polymorphism:** Recognise the type of polymorphism suitable for your needs. Not every situation benefits from the same type of polymorphism.

3. **Design for Interface, not Implementation:** Focus on designing interfaces that abstract the underlying implementations. This promotes loose coupling and high cohesion in software design.

4. **Test Polymorphic Components Thoroughly:** Ensure thorough testing of polymorphic components, as their behaviour might change depending on the runtime object they operate on.

Polymorphism is a powerful concept in programming that, when used correctly, can greatly enhance the flexibility, maintainability, and reusability of code. By understanding and applying its principles thoughtfully, developers can build more abstract and high-level interfaces that hide complex implementations, making their code more adaptable and easier to work with.
